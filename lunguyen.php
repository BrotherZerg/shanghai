		<h2>Education</h2>

			<p>I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester, Class of 2019. I am majoring in <strong>Digitial Media Studies</strong> and minoring in <em>Computer Sciences</em>. I love to design everything like objects, graphics, or website. I am transfer student after graduating past college as knowns as Monroe Community College with Mathematics degree. But I have changed my major to DMS because I think designing is approriately best suit for me. This is a reason why I am taking CSC 174 course. I had planed to earn Bachelor degree in University of Rochester and Master degree in Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
