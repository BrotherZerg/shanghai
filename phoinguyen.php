		<h4>Adam Struhl</h4>

		<h2>Education</h2>

			<p>I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester, Class of 2018. I am majoring in <em>Digitial Media Studies</em> and <em>Creative writing</em>. I enjoy creating things that look cool to me, which is esentially things that look good to my design aesthetic.  I'm a pretty big fan of Sci-Fi, whether it be ultra-modern or cyberpunk, and I think that the former influences my personal aesthetics more than a little.</p>

		<h2>Work Experiences</h2>

			<p>I have spent some time as an intern at the web company WebnBeyond, as well as few contract jobs for Magic Masters signs that required a lot of graphics design work and organization.</p>

		<h3>Clubs and Organization</h3>

			<p>I am a long-standing member fo the Anime Interest Floor.  I spent my sophmore year working as their PR manager before becoming the President of the organization in my Junior year.  I am currently serving a second term as president, and am working towards improving the group by increasing the number of cool and unique events that we do.</p>
